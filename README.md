# Sound Mind: User Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how music listening habits impact mental health ratings for anxiety, OCD, depression, and insomnia. By examining a unique dataset that links mental health with music preferences, we aim to provide recommendations for music listening based on demographic factors like age and music listening habits. This exploration is particularly exciting because music is a universal experience, and uncovering its potential to influence mental health is both fascinating and valuable.

## Collaboration & Teamwork  
Working with teammates Taylor Justesen ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylorjustesen208)) and Sam Theilen ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-theilen)) across different time zones was a valuable experience. Over the course of five days, we met four times, carefully balancing our schedules to accommodate time differences. Each meeting was structured with clear goals and assignments, ensuring everyone remained aligned and prepared for the next steps. This intentional organization and communication allowed us to collaborate efficiently, tackle challenges proactively, and complete tasks on time, demonstrating the power of teamwork even in a remote, asynchronous setting.

## Dataset
The dataset, included in the repository, contains information about users' mental health ratings (anxiety, OCD, depression, insomnia) and their music listening habits, such as genres, beats per minute, listening locations, and engagement levels. Our task was to identify patterns and relationships within the data to help Sound Mind app users make informed music listening choices to support their mental well-being.

## Introduction
Sound Mind, a mental health app, aims to recommend music listening habits to users based on their mental health ratings. Our projectâ€™s goal was to determine which music genres, listening locations, engagement levels, and other factors have a significant impact on self-reported mental health. We built an interactive dashboard to visualize and provide tailored music recommendations based on user data.

## Project Objectives
1. Identify the impact of music listening habits (genre, beats per minute, engagement level) on mental health ratings (anxiety, OCD, depression, insomnia).
2. Build an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter recommendations based on their demographic and music preferences.
3. Provide insights into how various aspects of music listening, such as genre mixing and listening duration, affect mental health.

## Methodology

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Addressed missing values and standardized data.
- Grouped data into cohorts to simplify analysis, such as categorizing beats per minute (BPM) into different ranges (slow, moderate, fast).

2. Data Analysis:
- Analyzed relationships between music preferences (genre, BPM, location, etc.) and mental health ratings.
- Broke down BPM into categories to reveal patterns, such as slower music being linked to higher anxiety and OCD.

3. Dashboard Development:
- Created an interactive Tableau dashboard with filters to allow users to explore recommendations based on age, music genre, listening location, and more.
- Focused on making the visualizations clear and understandable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Visual Representations  
Visualizing user engagement levels and mental states provided key insights into listening habits and behaviors.  

**Mental State and Listening Location**  
A comparative analysis of user mental states when listening in work environments versus non-work environments revealed notable differences. These insights helped tailor recommendations based on location-specific needs.

**Mental State and Hours of Engagement by Age Group**  
Exploring how mental states correlated with engagement hours across different age groups unveiled trends that informed age-specific strategies.

**Song Pace and Genre Effects on Mental Health**  
Analyzing song pace and genre highlighted their unique impacts on mental health, emphasizing the importance of personalized music recommendations.

**Interactive Tableau Dashboard**  
An interactive Tableau dashboard was created, allowing users to modify filters and generate targeted music recommendations based on age and listening habits. This tool provided actionable insights into user preferences.

## Main Features of the Project
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard:** Users can filter music recommendations based on demographics, music habits, and self-reported mental health.
- **Data Cohorts:** Cohorts based on age, genre mixing, and music pace help reveal deeper insights into the data.
- **Mental Health Ratings Analysis:** Identified how different music listening habits impact mental health, particularly for anxiety, OCD, depression, and insomnia.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights the potential of tailored music recommendations to promote mindfulness and reduce anxiety, stress, and other negative mental states. By examining user preferences and mental states, the findings emphasize the importance of enhancing listening habits through dynamic filtering and robust scoring systems. This data-driven approach ensures music selections positively influence focus, relaxation, and overall mental well-being, underscoring the significant role analysis can play in fostering healthier, more mindful lifestyles.  

## Future Directions
We plan to continue refining this project by exploring additional factors that might influence mental health ratings, such as favorite genre or specific listening habits. The dashboard could also be optimized to include more targeted recommendations for users. We look forward to expanding this project and discovering even more ways music can impact mental well-being.
